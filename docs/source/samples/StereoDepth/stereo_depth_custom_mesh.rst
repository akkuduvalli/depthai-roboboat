Stereo Depth custom Mesh
========================

This example shows how you can load custom mesh to the device and use it for depth calculation.
In this example, mesh files are generated from camera calibration data, but you can also use
your own mesh files.

By default, :ref:`StereoDepth` will use the same logic as inside the ``def getMesh()`` to calculate
mesh files whenever horizontal FOV is larger than 90Â°. You could also force calculate the mesh using:

.. code-block:: python

    stereo = pipeline.create(dai.node.StereoDepth)
    # Enable mesh calculation to correct distortion:
    stereo.enableDistortionCorrection(True)


StereoDepth node also allows you to load mesh files directly from a file path:

.. code-block:: python

    stereo = pipeline.create(dai.node.StereoDepth)
    stereo.loadMeshFiles('path/to/left_mesh', 'path/to/right_mesh')

On the image above you can see that the rectified frame isn't as wide FOV as the original one,
that's because the distortion correction is applied (in this case via custom mesh files), so the
disparity matching can be performed correctly.
